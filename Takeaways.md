# Web Design


## UX part
### Lesson 1

1. **Always** start a  web project with a brief.
2. In the brief, be clear about **what** you're making and **who** are you making it for.
3. Be as **detailed** as possible regarding the final content and include that in the brief
4. The project brief will serve as a **basis** for the wireframe


### Lesson 5 What are wireframes (sketch, blueprint) are?

a. A wireframe is a low-fidelity version of the final design
b. wireframe should display the final content as well as its structure
c. wireframe should be devoid of any intentional aesthetic decisions like color or typography.

### Color theory

Types of color:
Primary colors: Red Yellow Blue
There are also Secondary and tertiary colors.

1. Hue - represents the main color in our color gamma

## Lesson 8
### Color Phycology

1. Colors can have different meanings in different scenarios or cultures.
2. Color harmonies allows us to create a color palette
3. Use Adobe Color tool


## Lesson 9
### Creating a color palette for our project

1. When starting a design process, it is always easier to begin with colors.
2. Create the palette for primary colors first and then the secondary colors and then move to greys.
3. When creating the greys, mix in a bit of the primary color.
4. Make that every color you're using for text of interactive elements has enough contrast.


## Lesson 10
### Typography

1. Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts
2. Decide which web fonts would work best for the **brand** and **audience**, based on the message your website should convey.
3. Fonts should be also picked using criteria like: **readability** and **load time**
4. After you picked your fonts, you need to set the proper roles and attributes (size, line eight, weight, etc)


## Lesson 11
### Creating the typography for the project.
1. Brandon Grotesque and Proxima Nova
2. Start typography process by defining the type scale font weights and line heights
3. Use tools like type scale and archetype to make this task easier
4. Create text styles for paragraphs and headings


## Lesson 12
### Spacing and sizing

1. Use system of 8. All paddings, margins and other element attributes should be dividable by 8.
2. Using guides for this project


## Lesson 13
### Icons and Imaginary in Web Design

#### Icons
1. iconset.io free app for organizing icons.  Bootstrap icons, font awesome, hero icons, ionicons, forge icons.
2. Icons should be meaningful and use consistent style throughout.
3. Some icons works just fine by themselves but mostly we would need to pair them with text.

#### Images

## Lesson 14
### Definitions and Uses for Headers

1. A website header is usually the top section of a webpage that contains logo, navigation bar, call-to-action and optionally a search form. (generic definition)

3. Headers can be vertical

A hero section is the area immediately below or next to the header. Because this is positioned above the fold, it's considered prime real-estate soo it displays critical information like the brand offering, benefits for working with the  and (strong message, supporting media and) call-to-action.


## Lesson 17
### Design button

In UI Design, a button is a fundamental interactive element that serves as a middleman between the user and the product or service


Tips about BUTTONS:

1. We need to make it clickable, easy to find (bright colors ) Easy to tab on small screens.
2. We need to tell users what the button is doing



## Lesson 18
### Image Galleries

1. An Image gallery is a way of displaying a collection of images while allowing users to see several images at once.
2. Image galleries are heavily used in online stores to show product variations or angles.
3. Galleries can also be linked to a slideshow that will display larger versions of the images.


## Lesson 19
### Footers

1. A Website footer is an area positioned at the bottom of every page on a website, right below the main content.
2. Footers usually contain the information that improves the usability of the website.
