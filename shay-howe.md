## Lesson 3

### Spaces Within Selectors
Within the previous combined selector, `.hotdog p.mustard`, there is a space between the hotdog class selector and the paragraph type selector but not between the paragraph type selector and the mustard class selector. The use, and omission, of spaces makes a large difference in selectors.

Since there isnâ€™t a space between the paragraph type selector and the mustard class selector that means the selector will only select paragraph elements with the class of mustard. If the paragraph type selector was removed, and the mustard class selector had spaces on both sides of it, it would select any element with the class of mustard, not just paragraphs.

The best practice is to not prefix a class selector with a type selector. Generally we want to select any element with a given class, not just one type of element. And following this best practice, our new combined selector would be better as `.hotdog .mustard`.
